#### **Summary:**

- Canada recorded a trade surplus of $1.03 billion in February.
- Reason behind it was a record level of unwrought gold shipments which helped exports rise above imports value.
- Total exports rose 5.8% to $49.43billion since August and imports increased 4.6% since June
- Economic growth rebounded since 2023
- GDP likely expanded 0.4% in February. This will most likely ease the pressures on central banks in regards to interest rates cuts
- Policies previously implemented included high 5% interest rates to lower inflation levels. It results in smaller consumer spending yet has not truly eased the fears of a recession happening. Next monetary policy decision is said to be issued on April 10 by BoC(Bank of Canada)
- Imports on consumer goods increased (clothing, footwear and accessories biggest increase).
- Nine out of 11 export sections saw a rise in the month.

#### **Summary:** 
- India aims to achieve an easing of EU steel import quotas and tariffs. The steel makers in India struggle to sell the alloy in the market, which is one of the world's biggest.
- Last year the two parties relaunched negotiations for a free trade agreement, hoping to end them by the end of 2023.
- EU is protecting its steelmakers with the use of quotas and tariffs (link to trade protectionist measures)
- Issues of carbon dioxide emissions tariff are also said to be expressed. These are a protectionist measure to protect the environment from polluting goods such as steel and cement
- Last month India implemented anti-dumping import duties on stainless steel seamless tubes and pipes from China. The government is working on another set of protectionist measures such as 23 new quality control orders against low-quality imports.
