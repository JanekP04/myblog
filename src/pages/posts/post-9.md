**Summary**:
- Due to government plans Britainâ€™s inflation is at its lowest rate for two years and the GDP figures reflect it. In consequence, the living costs crisis will ease. 
- Regardless, prices are still rising and average incomes have seen limited growth.
- GDP per capita has  grown by 5.6% since 2007 and annual increase is less than 0.4%. Before 2007 for 17 years the growth amounted to 45% and annual increases of 2.7% showing that this momentum has slowed. 
- Absence of economic growth has reflected in less employment t opportunities, lower household incomes and standards of living.
- The reasons behind this situation are COVID, Brexit and global financial crisis combined, which have affected the whole world.
- UK operates on progressive tax rates system. 
- In UK high marginal income taxes affect all people. It is indicated in research that high marginal income tax rates impact the financial incentive for people to seek employment or better paid jobs. This negatively impacts the economy as there is a significant difference between the cost of employment and the wages. As this impacts employment in consequence it stifles economic growth.
