#### **Classical Economics**
Classical economics emerged during the 18th and 19th centuries and emphasises principles such as free markets, minimal government intervention, and the efficiency of resource allocation through the price mechanism. Scholars like Adam Smith and David Ricardo are associated with classical economic thought, advocating for concepts such as comparative advantage and the invisible hand.

Jean-Baptiste Say's Law of Markets, formulated by the French economist Jean-Baptiste Say, posits that "supply creates its own demand." In other words, the production of goods and services generates income for producers, which, in turn, enables them to demand other goods and services in the market.

#### **Neoclassical Economics**
Neoclassical economics builds upon classical economics but incorporates mathematical modelling and optimization techniques to analyse individual behaviour, market equilibrium, and welfare economics. Neoclassical economists focus on utility maximisation, rational decision-making, and the importance of marginal analysis in determining consumer and producer behaviour.

The Labor Theory of Value, proposed by classical economists such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo, suggests that the value of a good or service is determined by the amount of labour required for its production. According to this theory, the more labour inputs (including both physical and mental effort) needed to produce a good or service, the higher its value.

The Law of Marginal Utility states that as a consumer consumes more units of a particular good or service, the additional satisfaction or utility derived from each additional unit decreases.

Rational Choice Theory in economics posits that individuals make decisions by evaluating the costs and benefits of various options and choosing the one that maximises their utility or satisfaction. This theory assumes that individuals have consistent preferences, perfect information, and the ability to make optimal decisions given their constraints. Rational choice theory forms the basis of much economic analysis, including consumer behaviour, producer decisions, and the functioning of markets. However, critics argue that it may oversimplify human behaviour and fail to account for factors such as bounded rationality, cognitive biases, and social influences.

#### **Keynesian Economics**
Keynesian economics, developed by John Maynard Keynes in the 20th century, challenges classical assumptions and emphasises the role of aggregate demand in driving economic fluctuations. Keynesian economists advocate for active fiscal policy measures, such as government spending and taxation, to stabilise output, employment, and inflation in the short run. They argue that market economies can experience prolonged periods of unemployment and underutilization of resources, requiring government intervention to achieve full employment and macroeconomic stability.

#### **Monetarism**
Monetarism, associated with economists like Milton Friedman, emphasises the role of monetary policy in influencing aggregate demand and controlling inflation. Monetarists advocate for a rule-based approach to monetary policy, focusing on controlling the money supply to achieve long-term price stability. They argue that excessive government intervention in the economy, particularly through discretionary fiscal policy, can lead to inflation and economic instability.

#### **Behavioural economics**
Behavioural economics integrates insights from psychology into economic analysis to understand how individuals make decisions that may deviate from traditional economic models of rationality. It recognizes that individuals' choices are influenced by cognitive biases, heuristics, social norms, and emotions, which can lead to systematic deviations from rational behaviour. Behavioural economics explores phenomena such as loss aversion, framing effects, and bounded rationality to provide a more realistic understanding of decision-making processes.
