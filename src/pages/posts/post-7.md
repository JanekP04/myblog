# Measuring economic progress

#### **Economic development**
Economic development is a multidimensional concept. It could be defined as an improvement in living standards or economic welfare, wellbeing.

#### **Economic growth**
It is an increase in the real output of the economy.

To measure economic progress we use single and composite indicators. In this part some examples would be showcased. Of course it should be taken into account that inaccuracies of different sorts may appear when data is collected for all indicators.

#### **Single indicators**
- Financial measures such as GDP, GDP per capita and GNI along with GNI per capita. GDP can be defined as the total of all economic activity in a country, regardless of asset ownership, per capacity simply means that this value is divided by the number of population. GNI on the other hand is defined as the total income that is earned by a country's factors of production, regardless of their location.
- PPP in other words Purchasing Power Parity, it is defined as an exchange rate created to equate the purchasing power of currencies in different countries to measure and compare price levels.
- Health measures such as life expectancy at birth and infant mortality rate
- Education measures known as expected years of schooling and mean years of schooling
- Economic/social inequality indicators for example pay inequality, access to credit etc.
- Energy indicators in terms of energy poverty
- Environmental indicators such as level of greenhouse emissions or ocean temperatures.
- Unemployment rate

#### **Composite indicators**
- Human Development Index (HDI) measures three aspects: long and healthy life, improved education and decent standards of living.
- The Gender Inequality Index (IGI) which focuses on gender inequalities. It measures  reproductive health, empowerment and economic status.
- Inequality adjusted HDI (IHDI), which adjusts the HDI components then adjusted for inequality.
- Happy planet Index(HPI) focused on  wellbeing, life expectancy, inequality of incomes and ecological footprint.
- The Multidimensional Poverty Index(MPI) measures the deprivations in three areas: health, education and standards of living.
- The Inclusive Development Index (IDI) that takes into account 103 countries, economic performance. The main components are growth and development, inclusion and integrational equity and stability.
- Happiness Index (HI) which measures economic well being in forms of happiness levels.
- OECD Better life Index which measures 11 topics in two categories:material living conditions(housing, income etc.) and quality of life(community, education etc.).
